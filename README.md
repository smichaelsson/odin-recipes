Hello! 

Welcome to my first website. In it, I have created detailed and carefully crafted
recipes for water and its varying forms. I have practiced and demonstrated a rudimentary use of html and git basics, using git commands like "add", "commit", "status" and so on, as well as coding html boilerplates, links and images. I hope you enjoy :)
